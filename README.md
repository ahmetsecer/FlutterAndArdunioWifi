# Communication with Flutter and Arduino via Wi-Fi

This project includes a sample IoT (Internet of Things) application that aims to communicate over Wi-Fi using Flutter and Arduino. The project controls an Arduino (ESP8266 or ESP32) device using a smartphone's Wi-Fi connection via the Flutter application. The goal of this project is to provide a starting point for understanding and customizing communication between mobile devices and IoT devices.

## Project Features

- Developed using Flutter and Arduino (ESP8266 or ESP32).
- Provides communication via Wi-Fi connection between the mobile application and the device.
- The app can perform basic operations such as turning the device on and off.
- Includes error management and security measures during communication.
